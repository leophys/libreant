Arch
~~~~~

    sudo pacman -Sy python2 python2-virtualenv elasticsearch

Python dependencies

Install libreant and all python dependencies::

    ./ve/bin/pip install libreant

Upgrading
----------

Generally speaking, to upgrade libreant you just need to::

    ./ve/bin/pip install -U libreant

And restart your instance (see the :ref:`sys-execution` section).

Some versions, however, could need additional actions. We will list them all in
this section.

Upgrade to version 0.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

libreant now supports elasticsearch 2. If you were already using libreant 0.4, you were using elasticsearch 1.x.
You *can* continue using it if you want. The standard upgrade procedure is enough to have everything working.
However, we suggest you to upgrade to elasticsearch2 sooner or later.


Step 1: stop libreant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more info, see :ref:`sys-execution`; something like ``pkill libreant`` should do

Step 2: upgrade elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just apply the steps in :ref:`sys-installation` section as if it was a brand new installation.

.. note::

    If you are using archlinux, you've probably made pacman ignore elasticsearch package updates.
    In order to install the new elasticsearch version you must remove the ``IgnorePkg elasticsearch`` line in ``/etc/pacman.conf``
    *before* trying to upgrade.

Step 3: upgrade DB contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libreant ships a tool that will take care of the upgrade. You can run it with
``./ve/bin/libreant-db upgrade``.

This tool will give you information on the current DB status and ask you for
confirmation before proceding to real changes. Which means that you can run it
without worries, you're still in time for answering "no" if you change your mind.

The upgrade tool will ask you about converting entries to the new format, and upgrading the index mapping (in elasticsearch jargon, this is somewhat similar to what a ``TABLE SCHEMA`` is in SQL)
